 CS-2012 sec-01 Final Exam - Programming Exercise

Write the supporting Class files for the Visit the Museum program.

Upload all for your work in a zip file.



This final will require you to write the supporting class and interface files that will be used by the main program when it runs.

The file structure, package names, class and interface names, and all of the method names are predefined and should match those in the main program so that it will properly function.

The file structure will look like this:
Make sure that you name the package 'museum'.

── src
   └── museum
       ├── Artifact.java
       ├── Cursed.java
       ├── Dinosaurs.java
       ├── Exhibit.java
       ├── MedievalArmor.java
       ├── Mummy.java
       ├── MyPersona.java
       └── StartMuseumMain.java



I have included these files for you to use:
(use the download arrow at the end of the link to download, Canvas just sort of spins on the file if you try to open it here)

StartMuseumMain.java   StartMuseumMain-2.java
Download StartMuseumMain-2.java
MyPersona.java   MyPersona-1.java Download MyPersona-1.java
Cursed.java  StartMuseumMain-3.java

Download StartMuseumMain-3.java



I have also uploaded these to GitHub:

Links to an external site.



You have to provide the rest of the program files.

Make sure to not change the files StartMuseumMain.java and Cursed.java. I will be using my own copies of those files to run and check your work, changing them may cause your program break.

You must change the MyPersona.java file to contain your information not mine. I will be using that to help me assign your grade to you.

The Artifact Class and its sub classes should not implement a no-argument constructor.

The Exhibit class will need to have a no-argument constructor.

=======================================


Artifact.java
MedievalArmor.java
Mummy.java
Dinosaurs.java
Exhibit.java

The Sub-classes must not implement a no-argument constructor.
  for example, new Mummy() should fail, but new Mummy("zondar") should work.
